        <h3>How does the scoring system work?</h3>
        <p>
          Your score is based on the efficiency of your movements. Higher-value
          motions that cover more ground with fewer keystrokes earn more points.
          The game rewards you for using advanced Vim techniques rather than
          basic arrow key movements.

      <div class="terms-section">
        <h3>Can I play offline?</h3>
        <p>
          Boba.vim requires an internet connection for full functionality,
          including multiplayer modes, leaderboards, and progress tracking.
          However, the core learning experience and solo practice modes work
          with minimal connectivity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="terms-section">
        <h3>Is Boba.vim suitable for complete beginners?</h3>
        <p>
          Absolutely! Boba.vim is designed for all skill levels. Start with
          tutorial maps, consult the manual when needed, and let Uncle Boba
          guide you through the basics. The game progressively introduces more
          complex motions as you improve.
